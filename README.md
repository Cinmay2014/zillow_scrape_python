# Introduction

I made some changes based on the original version and added the scheduled email sending code. If you also want to use Gmail, you can go to your Gmail [account setting -> Security] to find the [App passwords] in section [Signing to Google]. You can create a 16 digits password for your code.


Simply change the city and run the code you will get the results.
